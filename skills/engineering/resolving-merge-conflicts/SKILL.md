1. **See the current state** of the merge/rebase. Check git history and conflicting files; search the Obsidian vault for the relevant decisions and issues.

2. **Find the primary sources** for each conflict. Understand deeply why each change was made, and what the original intent was. Read the commit messages, check the PRs, check original issues/tickets.

3. **Resolve each hunk.** Preserve both intents where possible. Where incompatible, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off. Do **not** invent new behaviour. Always resolve; never `--abort`.

4. Discover the project's **automated checks** and run them, typically typecheck, then tests, then format. Fix anything the merge broke.

5. **Finish the merge/rebase when explicitly authorized.** Report the verified state and the exact `git add`, `git merge --continue`, or `git rebase --continue` command the user needs. Do not finalize, commit, or push unless the user explicitly asks in this conversation.
